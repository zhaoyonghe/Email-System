Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
There'll be something missing
And now that you found it
It's gone
Now you feel it you don't
You've gone off the rails
So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You'll go to Hell
For what your
Dirty mind is thinking
